# MarkovChainTextGenerator
Simple Markov Chain Text Generator. Project done as a side project in order to learn more about deep learning and its implementation in python.

The Markov Chain Text Generator is a program that takes a file with text as training data. This program creates a Markov Chain out of the training data, where the weights are the probability for one word to follow the other. All words in the text are represented in the chain. With this Markov Chain, the program can be able to predict to some extenet what words are coming after an input from the user.
